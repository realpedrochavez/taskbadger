Accountability App.

ABOUT:

Welcome to the Task Badger accountability app. This app is being designed by new programmers in multiple platforms who all met at Pedro’s Dev’s Study Group (pedrosdevstudygroup.com). The purpose of the app is to provide the group and anyone who downloads the app with a fun and interactive way to monitor the’re learning or creative projects and progress.

Ultimately, the app should help people state their goals to other people and thus provide some social pressure to complete their goals.

FUNCTIONALITY:

The app allows a user to add an overall goal and a weekly goal. The overall goal is a long term project or outcome that the user wants to achieve. Examples of overall goals can be finishing a course or getting a job. The weekly goals are goals that a user can change once a week. Before a user can change there weekly goals they must press a check or an x button to indicate whether they have met there goal for the last week. Long term goals and short term goals are published on a public feed that all users of the Task Badger app can see.

A. This app is composed of 6 screens.

Screen One - Startup Screen

This screen briefly displays the Task Badger Logo and an inspirational quote

Screen two - Login Screen

This screen is a simple log in and registration page. There will be email and password registration using Firebase (google firebase).

Screen three - Main Screen

The main screen is the first screen the user sees after logging in. It is composed of 6 components. First, a place where the overall goal is placed at the top of the screen. Second, an area where trophies are collected by the user. See Trophies. Third, a place were the user can submit there goal for the week. Fourth, two buttons - one with a check and another with an x - that a user can press to indicate whether they completed or did not complete their goal for the week. Note, that a weekly goal cannot be changed or updated until the user has either pressed the check or the x button. Fifth, a navigation menu at the bottom of the screen that show the user that they are in (1) the main screen and can navigate them to either (2) the profile settings screen or (3) the community feed page.

Screen four - Feed Page
The feed page is were the goals a user sets, and whether they accomplished them are published. Any user of the app can see the feed. The feed is populated when a user submits a overall goal, when a user submits there weekly goal, and when a user presses the check or x button (which reposts the weekly goal accompanies by text that says either accomplished or failed). The bottom of the screen also has navigation buttons identical to screen three.

Screen Five - Settings Page

The settings page has 5 components. A section where the user can change their username - which is how they will be identified. A section where the user can select one of 10 user icons - that will further identify them. Third, A logout button. And finally, a email address link so the user can submit proof that they achieved their overall goal.The bottom of the screen also has navigation buttons identical to screen three and four.

Screen Six - Loading Page

The loading page will display whenever there is a lag in the user experience. It will show loading and an inspirational quote.

III. OWNERSHIP OF THE APP - COPYRIGHT

Any one that contributes to the initially published product of the app can claim an equal ownership share of the application. No minimum or maximum amount of contribution is required to claim this ownership share. The originator of the app idea can claim an ownership share for having successfully pitched the app to the group. In other words the originator of the app idea can potentially receive 2 equally apportioned ownership shares - one for his or her contribution to the app and one for coming up with the idea. 

For the sake of this app. Pedro Chavez is the originator of the idea, and thus automatically gets one equal share of the app. Further, if Pedro Chavez contributes to the initial publication he will receive a second equal share for his participation.

VESTING OF OWNERSHIP

Ownership of this app vests automatically upon the initial publishing of any of the following 4 components of the app.

(1) Initial publication of the IOS version of the application
(2) Initial publication of the ANDROID version of the application
(3) Initial publication of the Web Based version of the application
(4) Initial publication of the Website to promote the application

After initial publication a future contributor to the app can no longer claim an ownership share in the app. In other words, the owners of the app will be decided based on whether they contributed to 1 of the 4 publications upon its initial publication state - not for any revisions or additions to the application.

B. Devesting of Ownership Prior to Publication

Through unanimous vote by all ownership share holders, up to two contributors can be divested of their ownership share for failure to contribute anything substantive to the application prior to its initial publication. The person who successfully pitched the idea for the app can never lose their ownership share granted to them for the idea of the app. However, if the person who came up with the idea failed to contribute to the project, they can lose their contribution share - leaving them with only a single equal share rather than two.
